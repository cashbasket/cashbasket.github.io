                    <h2>About Ryan</h2>
                    <p><strong>Ryan Machan</strong> has been into coding for a long time. From the day he first learned a few random HTML tags from a high school classmate, Ryan has been consistently working on websites and honing his craft, both for his own enjoyment and [hopefully] the enjoyment of others.</p>
        
                    <p>Ryan has worked primarily in the higher education sector, creating sophisticated and user-friendly websites and web applications for use by faculty, staff and students. From public-facing, marketing-focused sites to event registration sites to administrative web apps, he has worked on a wide variety of things over the years. He loves learning new programming languages, frameworks, and concepts in general.</p>

                    <p>After becoming proficient with frontend design and development, Ryan was introduced to the backend via <strong>Coldfusion</strong> and <strong>Microsoft SQL Server</strong>. After that, he learned all about object-oriented programming via <strong>C#</strong>. These days, he primarily builds sites using <strong>ASP.NET (C#)</strong>  and <strong>JavaScript (Node.js)</strong>  with SQL Server, <strong>MySQL</strong>, and even <strong>Firebase</strong>; while backend JavaScript is technically his most recent major discovery, it is probably his most pleasant discovery as well.</p>

                    <p>In his spare time, Ryan is a complete music nerd in virtually every way; he has probably spent more money on albums than he has on food at this point. He also enjoys horror movies, stand-up comedy, football, sci-fi anything, and video games of all kinds. Oh, and if you need to see an absolutely absurd meme or two (or three), let him know. Seriously.</p>

                            <p>This is the official website for the Weatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University. It is aimed primarily at prospective students, but also has numerous resources for current students, faculty, and staff. Ryan has worked on this site for many years with many different people (including external design firms) through many iterations, and has done everything from frontend/backend updates to building out new apps/sections/features to complete site overhauls. It is a beast in terms of size and scope, but it's seen many improvements over the years. It was initially built in raw HTML before Ryan's time - this site goes <strong>way</strong> back - and then became a Coldfusion website, but is in the process of being ported entirely to ASP.NET.</p>

Ryan worked on a small team, and was responsible for the search functionality (using the <a href="http://songkick.com" target="_blank">Songkick</a> API), as well as the RSVP system using Firebase, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS3 and HTML5. He also integrated the Google Calendar, Google Maps, and Google Sign-in APIs.</p>

It uses a custom-built system for arranging and positioning the images on the screen, because a) Ryan really wanted to figure out how to do something that looked like this, and b) Ryan did not know of the existence of <a href="https://masonry.desandro.com/" target="_blank">Masonry.js</a> at the time.  Even so, it was a lot of fun!</p>
