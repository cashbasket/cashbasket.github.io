                    <p>Ryan has worked professionally as a web developer for over 15 years, and has been building websites for longer than that. From marketing-focused websites to social apps to administrative apps, he has worked on a wide variety of things, and has a rather diverse skill set.</p>
                    <p>Though he has used other technologies over the years, he primarily works with ASP.NET (C#) and JavaScript (Node, React, Express, etc.) now, along with Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and MongoDB. He truly has a penchant for learning new things, and hopes to continue learning and applying as much as he can.</p>
                    <p>In his spare time, Ryan is a complete music nerd in virtually every way. He also enjoys creative writing, horror movies, stand-up/sketch  comedy, sci-fi anything, video games of all kinds &ndash; except the bad kind &ndash; and telling people to watch the first season of <em>Castle Rock</em> on Hulu.</p>

                            <p>This is the official website for the Weatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University. It is aimed primarily at prospective students, but also has numerous resources for current students, faculty, and staff. Ryan has worked on this site for many years with many different people (including external design firms) through many iterations, and has done everything from front-end/backend updates to building out new apps/sections/features to complete site overhauls. It is a beast in terms of size and scope, but it's seen many improvements over the years. It was initially built in raw HTML before Ryan's time - this site goes <strong>way</strong> back - and then became a Coldfusion website, but has since been ported to ASP.NET.</p>

                            <p>This is Ryan's passion project. In essence, it's an app that allows people who are really into music &ndash; or, perhaps, borderline obsessed with it &ndash; to write about music, discuss music with each other, recommend music to each other, and be reasonable while doing so. It was built with JavaScript (Node, React) and MySQL, and the <a href="https://www.spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify</a> API ended up winning the "Music API That Should Be Used for PROJECT 145" Award, though others were in the running.</p>
                            <p>Since Ryan has many, many ideas for additions and/or improvements, expect PROJECT 145 to evolve over time.</p>

Ryan worked on a small team, and was responsible for the search functionality (using the <a href="http://songkick.com" target="_blank">Songkick</a> API), as well as the RSVP system using Firebase, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS3 and HTML5. He also integrated the Google Calendar, Google Maps, and Google Sign-in APIs.</p>

It was built using <a href="https://www.vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue.js</a> and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap 4</a>. Ryan eventually beat the game without cheating, but he will admit it took him more than 2 tries.</p>

It was built with the basics: HTML5, CSS, JQuery. While Ryan doesn't judge his friends, and certainly doesn't use this app to determine whom he should and should not hang out with, he has nothing but respect for anyone who gets a score of 8 or above.</p>

It uses a custom-built system for arranging and positioning the images on the screen, because Ryan really wanted to figure out how to do something that looked like this. And yes, he knows about <a href="https://masonry.desandro.com/" target="_blank">Masonry.js</a>; he just wanted a challenge.</p>

								<p>Who doesn't love a good, old-fashioned, Norris-themed game? Starting off a perfectly innocent game of "Hangman" meant to test Ryan's front-end Javascript and CSS ability, <strong>Don't Let Chuck Norris Kick You in the Face</strong> became so much more. If you don't know anything about Chuck, it might be more difficult for you; if you DO know about Chuck... it will probably still be difficult for you.</p>

                        <p>Ryan loves talking to people. He's not big into the Facebook or the Twitter or the MySpace or the Friendster, but he's okay with that. Feel free to shoot him an email to talk shop, to provide feedback, to discuss potential projects, to tell him how good the new Enslaved album is (it's always true), or just to say hello!</p>
