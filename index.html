                    <p>Ryan has worked professionally as a web developer for over 15 years, and has been building websites for longer than that. From marketing-focused websites to social apps to administrative apps, he has worked on a wide variety of things, and has a rather diverse skill set.</p>
                    <p>Though he has used other technologies over the years, he primarily works with ASP.NET (C#) and JavaScript (Node, React, Express, etc.) now, along with Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and MongoDB. He truly has a penchant for learning new things, and hopes to continue learning and applying as much as he can.</p>
                    <p>In his spare time, Ryan is a complete music nerd in virtually every way. He also enjoys creative writing, horror movies, stand-up/sketch  comedy, sci-fi anything, video games of all kinds &ndash; except the bad kind &ndash; and telling people to watch the first season of <em>Dark</em> on Netflix.</p>
                    <p>You should watch the first season of <em>Dark</em> on Netflix.</p>

                            <p>This is the official website for the Weatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University. It is aimed primarily at prospective students, but also has numerous resources for current students, faculty, and staff. Ryan has worked with numerous other developers on this site, but has touched pretty much all of it, working on both the front and back end. It is written in ASP.NET (C#).</p>

                            <p>This is Ryan's passion project. In essence, it's an app that allows people who are really into music &ndash; or, perhaps, borderline obsessed with it &ndash; to write about music, discuss music with each other, recommend music to each other, and be reasonable while doing so. It was built with JavaScript on the front end (React) and back end (Node, Express), along with a MySQL database. The <a href="https://www.spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify</a> API ended up edging out the Discogs API in the "Music API That Should Be Used for PROJECT 145" race, for various reasons.</p>
                            <p>Since Ryan has many, many ideas for additions and/or improvements, expect this app to evolve over time.</p>

                            <p><strong><em>For the Tour</em></strong> is a web app that allows users to find out when and where their favorite bands are touring, as well as RSVP for shows and add shows to their Google calendar. Ryan worked on a small team, and was responsible for the search functionality (using the <a href="http://songkick.com" target="_blank">Songkick</a> API), as well as the RSVP system using Firebase, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS3 and HTML5. He also integrated the Google Calendar, Google Maps, and Google Sign-in APIs.</p>

                            <p><strong><em>Is This Game Good?</em></strong> was built for two reasons: a) Ryan wanted a way to catalog all the video games he's ever played, and b) Ryan wanted an excuse to build something with <a href="https://www.vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>. The premise of the site, i.e. the whole mathematicians-empirically-determining-whether-or-not-games-are-good part, started off as a joke, but ended up as... a joke. Not all the games he's played have been added yet &ndash; he's played a fair amount &ndash; but it will happen eventually.</p>

                            <p>Ryan basically built <strong><em>Old Video Game Trivia</em></strong> to test his friends who claim to know everything about old video games, as well as anyone else who may claim the same thing. It was built with the basics: HTML5, CSS, JQuery. While Ryan doesn't judge his friends, and certainly doesn't use this app to determine whom he should and should not hang out with, he has nothing but respect for anyone who gets a score of 8 or above.</p>

It uses a custom-built system for arranging and positioning the images on the screen, because Ryan really wanted to figure out how to do something that looked like this. And yes, he knows about <a href="https://masonry.desandro.com/" target="_blank">Masonry.js</a>; he just wanted a challenge.</p>

If you don't know anything about Chuck, it might be more difficult for you; if you DO know about Chuck... it will probably still be difficult for you.</p>
